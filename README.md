# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: systematic application of engeering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quility software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Phases of SDLC (Agile model): software development that emphasizes flexibility, collabaration respond to change and customer satisfaction
- Flexibility: 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering:is a systematic process used in engineering projects to define, document, and maintain requirements
Process:
- Feasibility study: The initial phase of a project involves conducting a feasibility study to determine if the project should move forward
- Requirement elicitation and analysis: Requirement elicitation involves gathering extensive information on what stakeholders require from a proposed system through various techniques such as interviews, focus groups, workshops, shadowing, surveys, and prototype testing.
- Software Requirement Specification: document is a detailed overview of the system's expected behavior, outlining its functions, capabilities, interfaces, and interactions with users
-  Software Requirement Validation: This phase checks the SRS for errors and ensures that it accurately reflects the client's requirements. Validation techniques include requirement reviews, prototype testing, and model validation
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
- modularity aims to improve software development by partitioning complex problems into more manageable sub-problems
- By dividing software into distinct modules, developers can manage, update, and scale parts of the application independently, leading to more efficient maintenance and easier scalability

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
- Unit testing:  is a software testing technique where individual components or units of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they perform as expected
- Integration testing: testing interaction between different components or subsystems
- System testing: is the process of testing the entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance testing: testing the software system against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
- Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code
- They are important in helping developers from different location to be able to work on oe project keeping track who did modification, without affecting the original software utill is approved
- Example: GIT/SVN: They provide developers with the ability to collaborate effectively, track changes, and maintain a history of modifications.
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
- 

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
- Software maintenance is a continuous process that occurs throughout the entire life cycle of the software system
Types: 
- Corrective Maintenance: This involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system
- Patching: It is an emergency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management
- Adaptive Maintenance: This involves modifying the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware or software, government policies, and business rules
- Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving functionality, performance, and reliability, and restructuring the software system to improve changeability.
- Preventive Maintenance: This involves taking measures to prevent future problems, such as optimization, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and implementing preventive measures such as backups
why is maintenance essential?
- Ensures software continues to function effectively and evolve over time.
- Addresses bugs and errors.
- Adapts to evolving technology.
- Enhances performance.
- Incorporates user feedback


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
